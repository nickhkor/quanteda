\title{Combine dfm objects by Rows or Columns}
\usage{
\method{cbind}{dfm}(...)

\method{rbind}{dfm}(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{\link{dfm} objects to be joined column-wise (\code{cbind}) or
row-wise (\code{rbind}) to the first}
}
\description{
Take a sequence of \link{dfm} objects and combine by columns or
rows, returning a dfm with the combined documents or features, respectively.
}
\details{
\code{cbind(x, y, ...)} combines dfm objects by columns, returning a
  dfm object with combined features from input dfm objects.  Note that this should be used
  with extreme caution, as joining dfms with different documents will result in a new row
  with the docname(s) of the first dfm, merging in those from the second.  Furthermore, 
  if features are shared between the dfms being cbinded, then duplicate feature labels will 
  result.  In both instances, warning messages will result.

\code{rbind(x, y, ...)} combines dfm objects by rows, returning a dfm
  object with combined features from input dfm objects.  Features are matched
  between the two dfm objects, so that the order and names of the features
  do not need to match.  The order of the features in the resulting dfm
  is not guaranteed.  The attributes and settings of this new dfm are not
  currently preserved.

\examples{
# cbind() for dfm objects
(dfm1 <- dfm("This is one sample text sample"))
(dfm2 <- dfm("More words here"))
cbind(dfm1, dfm2)

# rbind() for dfm objects
(dfm1 <- dfm(c(doc1 = "This is one sample text sample."), verbose = FALSE))
(dfm2 <- dfm(c(doc2 = "One two three text text."), verbose = FALSE))
(dfm3 <- dfm(c(doc3 = "This is the fourth sample text."), verbose = FALSE))
rbind(dfm1, dfm2)
rbind(dfm1, dfm2, dfm3)
