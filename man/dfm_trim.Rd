\title{trim a dfm using frequency threshold-based feature selection}
\usage{
dfm_trim(x, min_count = 1, min_docfreq = 1, max_count = NULL,
  max_docfreq = NULL, sparsity = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{dfm} object}

\item{min_count, max_count}{minimum/maximum count or fraction of features across all documents,
below/above which features will be removed}

\item{min_docfreq, max_docfreq}{minimum/maximum number or fraction of documents in which a feature
appears, below/above which features will be removed}

\item{sparsity}{equivalent to 1 - min_docfreq, included for comparison with
\pkg{tm}}

\item{verbose}{print messages}
}
\value{
A \link{dfm} reduced in features (with the same number 
  of documents)
}
\description{
Returns a document by feature matrix reduced in size based on document and 
term frequency, usually in terms of a minimum frequencies, but may also be in
terms of maximum frequencies.  Setting a combination of minimum and maximum 
frequencies will select features based on a range.
}
\note{
Trimming a \link{dfm} object is an operation based on the values 
  in the document-feature \emph{matrix}.  To select subsets of a dfm based on
  attributes of the features themselves -- such as selecting features 
  matching a regular expression, or removing features matching a stopword 
  list, use \code{\link{dfm_select}}.

\examples{
(myDfm <- dfm(data_corpus_inaugural[1:5]))

# keep only words occuring >=10 times and in >=2 docs
dfm_trim(myDfm, min_count = 10, min_docfreq = 2) 

# keep only words occuring >=10 times and in at least 0.4 of the documents
dfm_trim(myDfm, min_count = 10, min_docfreq = 0.4)

# keep only words occuring <=10 times and in <=2 docs
dfm_trim(myDfm, max_count = 10, max_docfreq = 2) 

# keep only words occuring <=10 times and in at most 3/4 of the documents
dfm_trim(myDfm, max_count = 10, max_docfreq = 0.75)

# keep only words occuring at least 0.01 times and in >=2 documents
dfm_trim(myDfm, min_count = .01, min_docfreq = 2)

# keep only words occuring 5 times in 1000, and in 2 of 5 of documents
dfm_trim(myDfm, min_docfreq = 0.4, min_count = 0.005)
