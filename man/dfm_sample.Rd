\usage{
dfm_sample(x, size = ndoc(x), replace = FALSE, prob = NULL,
  what = c("documents", "features"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the dfm object whose documents or features will be sampled}

\item{size}{a positive number, the number of documents or features to select}

\item{replace}{logical; should sampling be with replacement?}

\item{prob}{a vector of probability weights for obtaining the elements of the
vector being sampled.}

\item{what}{dimension (of a \link{dfm}) to sample: can be \code{documents} or
\code{features}}
}
\value{
A dfm object with number of documents or features equal to \code{size}, drawn 
  from the dfm \code{x}.
}
\description{
Sample randomly from a dfm object, from documents or features.

myDfm <- dfm(data_char_inaugural[1:10], verbose = FALSE)
