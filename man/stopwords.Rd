\details{
The stopword list is an internal data object named 
\code{\link{data_char_stopwords}}, which consists of English stopwords from
the SMART information retrieval system (obtained from 
\url{http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume5/lewis04a/a11-smart-stop-list/english.stop})
and a set of stopword lists from the Snowball stemmer project in different 
languages (see \url{http://snowballstem.org/projects.html}). Supported 
languages are Arabic, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek,
Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. 
Language names should be lower-case (except for "SMART" -- see below) and are
case sensitive.

\section{A note of caution}{
 Stop words are an arbitrary choice imposed by the
  user, and accessing a pre-defined list of words to ignore does not mean 
  that it will perfectly fit your needs. You are strongly encourged to 
  inspect the list and to make sure it fits your particular requirements. The
  built-in English stopword list does not contain "will", for instance, 
  because of its multiple meanings, but you might want to include this word 
  for your own application.
